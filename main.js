When the food or drink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it passes you by don\'t try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you yet, don\'t let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife, wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on offer and you will have a share in the gods\' power as well as their company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus and philosophers like them came to be called, and considered, divine.','Epictetus'}];
